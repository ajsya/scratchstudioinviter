# scratch-bot
A  self hostable Scratch bot that invites users to a studio.

## Requirments
- Python3
- requests
- scratchconnect v.2.1
  - <strong>v.2.1 required</strong>

  - make sure your scratch account is a manager in your studio

Make sure to edit the login variables in the python file.
I would also recommend changing the time between requests. It's very low for testing.
